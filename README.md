# Knowledgebase

Information drives every thought, decision, and action. In our increasingly complex world where logic and trust are hard to weave confidently, it is easy to get lost in noise, incur unknown risks, and waste large amounts of time and resources. Truth is the fundamental solution.

Truth is reality in its past, present, and future. What has been, what is, what could be, and what will be. Truth is the immediate state of the world and the complex patterns of cause-and-effect that structure the dynamics of change. Truth exists with and beyond our senses and thoughts.

Truth offers realism and accuracy. With realism, one maps abstract, sweeping ideals to specific, granular possibilities. With accuracy, one projects limited power towards intended results within their actual possibility control space.

## Folder Overview

Fundamental: An efficient list (keyword only) of fundamental ideas (general and domain-specific) with long-term value for critical thinking. Novices can scout the contextual progression (surrounding keywords/ideas) of their learning curve; experts can review for reinforcement (delayed repetition) and completion (fill knowledge holes). Like basic language and math, this information is meant to be read once, remembered intuitively, and reviewed infrequently.
