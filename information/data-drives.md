The 3 major players are Western Digital, Seagate, and Toshiba.

Western Digital acquired HGST (known for excellent drive reliability) in 2012 and finished the brand integration in 2018. They are carrying HGST's HDD tech forward with the Ultrastar series (2019).

Toshiba has small market share but provides reliable drives. Their upcoming capacity-oriented HDD product (2020) is the MG08 series.

Seagate is recovering from a poor track record of drive failures, especially in consumer models. Their strongest enterprise HDD product is the Exos series.
