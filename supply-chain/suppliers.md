Let's Encrypt

https://letsencrypt.org/

## Special

[Let's Encrypt]() - Free TLS Certificates - Non-profit certificate authority managed by the [Internet Security Research Group](https://letsencrypt.org/isrg/). Great cost-effective solution, though more of a technical process. We recommend a wildcard TLS certificate from a commercial certificate authority for longer-lasting, low-maintenance certificates.

## Standards

[GS1](https://www.gs1.org/) - Official global supplier of universal product codes (UPC) and other standards-related services for commerce.
