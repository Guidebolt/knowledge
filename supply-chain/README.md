# Suppliers

Our suppliers are primarily in Canada and the United States. Their lead-times are generally 2 business days for in-stock items (ex. fasteners), up to 1-2 weeks for normal fabrication (ex. CNC machining) and up to 16 weeks for build-to-order parts (ex. industrial grade electronics from specialized factories).
