# Tools - Electrical Design

We use [Kicad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org/) for most of our schematic-to-PCB ECAD work. This is a good free, open-source, cross-platform EDA suite sponsored by CERN and increasingly supported by the industry such as with the [Digikey Kicad Library](https://www.digikey.ca/en/resources/design-tools/kicad).

Industry-standard suites include:

* Altium
* Cadence (Allegro/Orcad)
* SIEMENS Mentor (PADS/Xpedition)
