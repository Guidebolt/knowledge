# Hand Tools

## General-Purpose Screwdriver

We use the Picquic Super 8 Plus. Strongly recommended.

[Product Info](http://picquic.ca/super-8-plus/)

Durable multi-bit screwdriver with a strong one-piece frame. Robust over-molded handle withstands high-torque tasks. Integrated single-bit holding slots reduces risk of drops and part juggling while changing bits. Magnetic bit holder reduces risk of dropping screws and bits in tight spaces and during one-handed periods.

## Retractable Utility Knife

We use the Stanley Classic 99. Strongly recommended.

[Product Info](https://www.stanleytools.com/products/american-heritage-tools/usa-knives/6-in-classic-99-retractable-utility-knife/10-099)

For safety, we generally prefer retractable over fixed blade. For durability, we prefer metal construction. Simple and economical. Ergonomic handle, 1-screw disassembly, integrated spare-blade compartment for deep convenience. Spare blade rattling can be dampened by inserting a wad of paper in the compartment.

## Dual-Unit Vernier Calipers

We use the Mitutoyo 530-312. Recommended.

[Product Info](https://ecatalog.mitutoyo.com/Vernier-Calipers-Series-530-Standard-Model-C1401.aspx)

Vernier calipers may require good eyesight and take a bit more time to read to precision, but they require no battery and have excellent pure-mechanical reliability as a dependable primary or backup.
