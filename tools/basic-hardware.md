# Tools - Basic Hardware

## Screwdriver

[Picquic Super 8 Plus](http://picquic.ca/super-8-plus/) - Strongly Recommended

Durable multi-bit screwdriver with a strong one-piece frame. Robust over-molded handle withstands high-torque tasks. Integrated single-bit holding slots reduces risk of drops and part juggling while changing bits. Magnetic bit holder reduces risk of dropping screws and bits in tight spaces and during one-handed periods.

## Utility Knife

For safety, prefer retractable over fixed blade. For durability, prefer metal construction.

[Stanley Classic 99](https://www.stanleytools.com/products/american-heritage-tools/usa-knives/6-in-classic-99-retractable-utility-knife/10-099)

Simple and economical. All-metal construction for dependable lifelong use. Ergonomic handle, 1-screw disassembly, integrated spare-blade compartment for deep convenience. Spare blade rattling can be dampened by inserting a wad of paper in the compartment.
