# Tools - Computer Workstations

We use dual-boot Windows/Linux on all our desktop/laptop engineering-workstations, with each OS on separate drives when possible (modular data processing).

For Windows, we simply use Windows 10. See [Windows 10 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10ISO).

For Linux, our preferred distributions are [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) LTS and [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Stable.

For storage disks, we have had excellent performance and longevity with the Samsung Pro series SSDs since 2012. Strongly recommended.

We use Sandisk and Samsung USB drives for:

* CAM file transfer
* Technical file transfer (ex. datasheets, MCAD drawings)
* Full disk backup software and images (ex. CloneZilla, bare metal dev)
* Live OS installers
