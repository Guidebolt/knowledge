# 3D Printing Tools

## FFF 3D Printer

We use the Lulzbot Taz Pro and Lulzbot Mini 2.

## PLA Filament

We use the 3D-Fuel Pro PLA series.

This uses Natureworks Ingeo Biopolymer 3D870. We like bioplastic filaments for their human and environmental safety, which enables low-risk handling and post-processing.

Use a 3D printer that supports a detachable data drive (ex. USB drive, SD card). Computer-tethered prints depend on a persistent data-link that incurs higher disruption risk (ex. sleep mode, loose cables, latency) and commits the computer to close physical proximity for the duration of the print.

Place your 3D printer on a hard, flat table surface for significantly improved print-bed stability, especially for larger work volumes. Uneven, soft tabletop surfaces can cause the print bed to sag and wobble at its corners, especially during fast and long travel movements, causing poor inter-filament adhesion across all XYZ dimensions.

Use an aggressive Z-offset (low nozzle-to-bed distance) to ensure tight XY adhesion and bed adhesion while minimizing first-layer-bottom bulging. A tight first-layer is essential for strong printing of the remaining layers.

Set a balanced nozzle-wipe temperature that is high enough to soften the on-nozzle filament and low enough to avoid filament dripping. Consistent nozzle-wiping is essential for worry-free, accurate pre-print calibration. A dirty nozzle can interfere with the automatic Z-probe sequence, either stopping the print or causing over-compensated software-bed-leveling (which ruins the first layer).

Set a high printing temperature within the material's safe range to ensure strong inter-filament adhesion. Avoid excessively high temperatures to avoid stringing, which is hazardous and can add significant post-processing work.

Set a high bed temperature to ensure first-layer bed-adhesion during the whole print.
