## Tools - Mechanical Design

We currently use [Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview) for 3D part design.

Based on valid concerns expressed in [this forum thread](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/moving-to-subscription/buh-bye-permanent-license/td-p/6916387), we are considering alternatives such as Solid Edge (SIEMENS) or BricsCAD (Hexagon).

[FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) is accessible and basically functional, but we consider the featureset and UI/UX too limited for professional workflows for now.
