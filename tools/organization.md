A portable label printer is essential for durable, high-clarity organization of tools and supplies. This label printer has a robust frame, long run-time (standard AA batteries), and fast operation. Use black on white vinyl and nylon cloth labels.

## Slider Bags

We use the ULINE and HEFTY series.

Reclosable slider transparent plastic bags offer unmatched space and weight efficiency with open-close convenience and reliability. Combine the 4x6in slider bag with 6x4x4in mailer boxes for compact category storage (ex. M3 fasteners).

## Small Parts Organizer

We use the Milwaukee Packout series.

Hard frame organizers are faster to see and access than individual bags. Prefer organizers with removable subcontainers for ease of parts transfer. We recommend the packout series for its sturdy single-frame construction, convenient latching stackability, and ergonomic primary latches.
