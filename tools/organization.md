# Tools - Organization

## Label Printer

A portable label printer is essential for durable, high-clarity organization of tools and supplies. 

[Brady BMP21-PLUS Label Printer](https://www.bradyid.com/en-us/product/bmp21-plus) - Strongly Recommended

This label printer has a robust frame, long run-time (standard AA batteries), and fast operation. Use black on white vinyl and nylon cloth labels.

## Small Parts Bag

Slider Plastic Bags - Strongly Recommended

Reclosable transparent plastic bags offer unmatched space efficiency and weight efficiency. Sliderlocks are the most reliable and convenient type of these bags. 4in x 6in is one of the smallest sizes you can get. Combine this bag size with a comparable box (6in L x 4in W x 4in H) for compact category storage (ex. M3 fasteners).

## Small Parts Organizer

Hard frame organizers are faster to see and access than individual bags. Prefer organizers with removable subcontainers for ease of parts transfer.

We recommend the packout series for its sturdy single-frame construction, convenient latching stackability, and ergonomic primary latches.
