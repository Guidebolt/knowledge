## Registration

In Canada, federal corporations are registered with [Corporations Canada](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cd-dgc.nsf/eng/home).

Before registration, the prospective name of a new federal corporation must be verified with a [NUANS corporate name search report](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/075.nsf/eng/home).

Registration (incorporation) always occurs under a specific corporate legislation. Canada offers 2 main corporate legislations:

* Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)
* Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act (CNCA)

The CNCA is similar to the CBCA and only differs in 2 major ways:

1. All CNCA companies are non-stock corporations. Instead of shareholders, they have directors, officers, and members.

2. All CNCA companies must prepare financial-statements/audits by a certified public accountant if the company exceeds legally-specified thresholds.

Federal incorporation may require extraprovincial registrations (ex. with Ontario for businesses operating in Ontario).

## Maintenance

Note: The federal corporation number (ID with Corporations Canada) is different from the federal business number (ID with Canada Revenue Agency).

Annually, a federal corporation must file a [corporate return with Corporations Canada](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cd-dgc.nsf/eng/cs07016.html).

Annually, a federal corporation must prepare financial statements (balance sheet, income statement) then file a [corporate tax return with the Canada Revenue Agency](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/corporation-income-tax-return.html).

Annually, a federal corporation must file a HST return with the CRA.

Annually or quarterly (variable), a federal corporation must file payroll deductions with the CRA.
