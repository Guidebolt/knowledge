ORDERING ID: BRADY, 139535

STANDARD: Transparent Slider Bags (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

Light-weight, compact (conforms to contents), fast-identify, fast open/close.

We've tried different sizes. Too small and the bags are slow because we can't reach in with a full hand and the top is more rigid. Too big and the bags are slow because more distance to slide-open/close, plus harder to fit in compact containers; but big bags can contain smaller bags nicely.

SIZE: 200mm X 175mm (8in X 7in) (great for standard use) (RECOMMENDED)

SIZE: 16in X 12in (intended to fit several smaller bags for categorized organization. fits inside a typical large plastic/kraft storage box)

SOLDER WIRE

TESTING: KESTER, 268 Series, Lead-Free (Halogen Free, No-Clean)

This has most of what we want but is not rated for cleaning with IPA.

We recommend the following solder-wire characteristics:

* SAC305 solder alloy (lead-free)
* low-activity no-halogen flux (category L0)
* no-clean flux, but cleanable with IPA

Solder-wire is normally thermally-stable.

SOLDER PASTE

PCB assembly with solder-paste can be very efficient if you have good tools for paste dispensing, part pick-and-place, and thermal reflow. 

We recommend the following solder-paste characteristics:

* SAC305 solder alloy (lead-free)
* thermally-stable (no refrigeration/warm-up required)
* low-activity no-halogen flux (category L0)
* no-clean flux, but cleanable with IPA

TESTING: CHIPQUIK, solder-paste no-fridge lead-free no-clean SAC305

ORDERING ID: TS391SNL250 (250 GRAM, JAR)

ORDERING ID: TS391SNL500C (500 GRAM, SYRINGE)

FLUX

We strongly recommend flux that is low-copper-penetration halogen-free composition for safety. This is marked "L0" as specified by ANSI/J-STD-004.

## Fluid Dispenser Accessories

[PRODUCT PAGE](https://www.nordson.com/en/divisions/efd/products/fluid-dispensing-systems/ultimusplus-i-ii-dispensers)

Note: We mainly use this to dispense solder paste and sometimes liquid-adhesive/potting compound. Includes a foot pedal for efficient/accurate manual dispensing. Instead of the touchscreen we prefer to use a wireless mouse (LOGITECH, M190). Use 80+ psi for fine gauge dispensing of solder paste; use steady mode for start-of-session purging (as noted in quick-start guide).

ACCESSORIES:

* 30cc adapter assembly, 0.9m (O-ID: 7012338)
* 30cc syringe barrel and piston, 20-pack (O-ID, 7012136)
* end cap, 20-pack (O-ID, 7012196)
* tip cap, pack (O-ID, 7012198)
* free dispensing tip kit

## Electrical Accessories

USB-C CABLE: ANKER, Powerline 3 USB-C to USB-C (white, 10ft) (female to female)

Quality: Commercial, High

* 60W max power
* 480Mbps max speed (USB2 datarate)

## Medium Storage

Mailer Boxes

Boxes offer good stackability and hard shell protection as a low-cost rigid part container. Mailer boxes add quick, tool-free reclosable convenience.

Hard Cases

NANUK - [Product Info](https://www.nanuk.com/)

Hard Organizers

MILWAUKEE, Packout Series - [Product Info](https://www.milwaukeetool.com/Products/Storage-Solutions/PACKOUT)

Hard frame organizers are faster to see and access than individual bags. Prefer organizers with removable subcontainers for ease of parts transfer. We recommend the packout series for its sturdy single-frame construction, convenient latching stackability, and ergonomic primary latches.
