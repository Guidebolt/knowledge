## Soldering Station

PACE, ADS200 Accudrive with Instant Setback Cubby

* 120W
* uses thermal tips

ORDERING ID: PACE, 8007-0579

RECOMMENDED

The PACE-ADS200 is a modern professional soldering station with integrated-heater thermal-tips, fast/accurate temperature control (120W max output, 177C to 454C typical, 1.1C idle stability, ANSI/J-STD-001), instant setback (requires special stand), up to 3 preset temperatures, and durable extruded-aluminum frame.

## Solder Wire

TESTING: KESTER, 268 Series, Lead-Free (Halogen Free, No-Clean)

This has most of what we want but is not rated for cleaning with IPA.

We recommend the following solder-wire characteristics:

* SAC305 solder alloy (lead-free)
* low-activity no-halogen flux (category L0)
* no-clean flux, but cleanable with IPA

Solder-wire is normally thermally-stable.

## Solder Paste

PCB assembly with solder-paste can be very efficient if you have good tools for paste dispensing, part pick-and-place, and thermal reflow. 

We recommend the following solder-paste characteristics:

* SAC305 solder alloy (lead-free)
* thermally-stable (no refrigeration/warm-up required)
* low-activity no-halogen flux (category L0)
* no-clean flux, but cleanable with IPA

TESTING: CHIPQUIK, solder-paste no-fridge lead-free no-clean SAC305

ORDERING ID: TS391SNL250 (250 GRAM, JAR)

ORDERING ID: TS391SNL500C (500 GRAM, SYRINGE)

## Flux

We strongly recommend flux that is low-copper-penetration halogen-free composition for safety. This is marked "L0" as specified by ANSI/J-STD-004.

## Fume Extractor

PACE, ARM-EVAC 150 with SteadyFlex Arm and Nozzle Assembly

ORDERING ID: 8889-0150-P1

## Hot Air Rework Station

QUICK, 861DW

* as recommended by EEVlog and Louis-Rossman
* dual-unit (supports both C and F units; hold CH2 and CH3 to switch)

## Work Plate

ALPHIDIA, Quadhands Jumbo Workbench (Powder-coated Steel, Magnetic-Base Flex-Holders)

## Microscope

AMSCOPE, 7X-45X Simul-Focal Stereo Lockable Zoom Microscope on Dual Arm Boom Stand

* stereo (3D vision)
* camera port
* simul-focal (concurrent use of stereo-view and camera-port)
* variable zoom and zoom lock
* metal levers

ORDERING ID: SM-4NTP

## Fluid Dispenser

NORDSON EFD, UltimusPlus 1 (10 to 100 psi, 2019 release)

ORDERING ID: 7364361

[PRODUCT PAGE](https://www.nordson.com/en/divisions/efd/products/fluid-dispensing-systems/ultimusplus-i-ii-dispensers)

Note: We mainly use this to dispense solder paste and sometimes liquid-adhesive/potting compound. Includes a foot pedal for efficient/accurate manual dispensing. Instead of the touchscreen we prefer to use a wireless mouse (LOGITECH, M190). Use 80+ psi for fine gauge dispensing of solder paste; use steady mode for start-of-session purging (as noted in quick-start guide).

ACCESSORIES:

* 30cc adapter assembly, 0.9m (O-ID: 7012338)
* 30cc syringe barrel and piston, 20-pack (O-ID, 7012136)
* end cap, 20-pack (O-ID, 7012196)
* tip cap, pack (O-ID, 7012198)
* free dispensing tip kit

## USB-C CABLE, POWER

ANKER, Powerline 3 USB-C to USB-C (white, 10ft) (female to female)

Quality: Commercial, High

* 60W max power
* 480Mbps max speed (USB2 datarate)
