# Meta, Thinking Techniques

## Think Time

* think-time modeling (structured thinking about why and how mental work takes time)
* intent
* checklist
* schedule
* today goals
* timestamping (pre-task/post-task)
* goal/task time estimation
* focus timeblock
* durable progress (value that is hard to lose/destroy; ex. well-stored toilet paper)
* if blocked, change task, return later
* if uncertain, prefer adaptable paths

## Design

* goal abstraction (ex. going to the grocery store, going to get food, preparing food to eat now/later, preparing to live, living to feel/be good)
* goal specification (ex. in this application, low-noise means under 50dB)
* goal decomposition (ex. low-noise means both low dB and smooth sound-type)
* relevant factor list (ex. safety, reliability, performance)
* needs vs wants
* feature list
* application list (normal cases, edge cases)
* ideal and real possibilities (consider a design space without constraints, comparing to one with today-constraints) (this is a spectrum space, not black-white space)
* practical ideas/options list (design elements and categories) (a complete list offers brute-force process of elimination)
* element combination (ex. multi-material design) 
* element division (ex. latch can divide into latch-frame, latch-lock, latch-interface, etc.)
* minimum functional design (material, complexity, data)
* single factor optimization
* min-max analysis (of specific value) (task scope or design scope)
* stack analysis (for sequential design layers) (abstract or concrete)
* option tree (trunk/branch)
* functional substitutes (what alternative functions/design-elements can somewhat replace this function?)
* functional absence (what happens to the design/operation of the system without this function?)
* user experience vs world state-changes (some changes are experienced not by intended users; instead by bystanders, other entities, and the rest of the universe) (world state-changes often indirectly affect the user experience)
* second-to-second UX simulation (small time-segment focus)
* A-Z UX simulation (step-completeness focus)
* lifetime simulation ("cradle-to-grave"; development and production and distribution to operation and maintenance and recycling)
* present-to-future simulation (reality-dynamics focus)
* application environment simulation
* constraint walk-forward (add modern constraints one-by-one into an empty design-space)
* constraint walk-back (remove constraints one-by-one from a draft in the design-space)
* first principles modeling (fundamental interactive laws)
* basic elements modeling (fundamental elements for desired function)
* false tradeoffs
* breakable assumptions/premises
* design path completion (do this for full-draft exploration/context; avoid tunnel-vision and first-idea only-idea bias)

## Evaluation

* current-reality research (ex. existing products)
* peer review
* guiding document research
* history research (ex. past intergenerational upgrade logic)
* experimental learning vs thoughtful learning (spectrum idea) (consider which is better for a specific situation, problem, current skillset) (ex. better to spend 1 hour thinking of problems and solutions than 10 hours building the same problems and solutions) (ex. better to spend 1 hour building problems and solutions than 10 hours thinking the same problems and solutions)
