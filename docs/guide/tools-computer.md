## Workstation Hardware

CASE: FRACTAL DESIGN, Meshify 2, solid-side-panel (recommended)

Reason: Easy to assemble, highly customizable, fast-access filters. Minor downside, bit heavy at 10kg.

CPU: AMD, Ryzen 5950X (strongly recommended)

Reason: Leading 16-core Workstation CPU at 105W TDP. Good single-core/multi-core performance, power efficiency, ECC support.

GPU: AMD

Reason: Good Linux compatibility.

FAN: NOCTUA, air-cooling (recommended)

Leading performance-noise ratio. We prefer the low-risk zero-maintenance longevity of air-cooling over liquid-cooling.

SSD: SAMSUNG (recommended)

We have a successful 8+ years track record with Samsung SSDs.

PSU: SEASONIC, Prime Fanless Series

We like the efficiency and reliability of fanless designs, especially when supported by 10+ year warranties.

MOUSEPAD: RAZER, Gigantus V2, XXL (410mm x 910mm x 4mm)



## Operating System

Primary: [DEBIAN](https://www.debian.org/)

Secondary: [WINDOWS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows)

Official download link for the Windows 10 ISO [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10ISO)

We like to install operating-systems on a per-drive basis (instead of multi-OS partitions on the same drive).

## Password Manager

We strongly recommend that you use a password-manager that works offline (without internet).

We strongly recommend that you regularly save a copy of your password-database to a back-up system.

[Keepass](https://keepass.info) - Free, open-source, good long-term track record. But out-dated, clunky GUI. Recommended.

[KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) - Free, open-source, cross-platform, modern GUI with v2.6+. A fork of Keepass with more active development that we are testing.

## Document Suite

[Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)

(RECOMMENDED)

Free, open-source, high-quality, cross-platform alternative to Microsoft Word for producing text documents, spreadsheets, slideshows, basic drawings, and simple databases. Great import/export compatibility for various file formats.

## Markdown Text Editor

STANDARD: [Ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/)

(RECOMMENDED)

We look for 2 major features in an efficient markdown editor:

* Header menu for one-click navigation to internal headers.
* HTML preview for one-click links to external websites.

## TEAM CHAT

STANDARD: [ZULIP](https://zulip.com/)

(STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

## MCAD

STANDARD: [Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview)

It's good but expensive. The built-in simulation is useful.

WAITING: [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) 

Usable but not ready for efficient professional workflows.

## ECAD

STANDARD: [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) 

(STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

We use this for most of our schematic-to-PCB ECAD work. This is a good free, open-source, cross-platform EDA suite sponsored by CERN and increasingly supported by the industry.

Alternatives include:

* Altium
* Cadence (Allegro/Orcad)
* SIEMENS Mentor (PADS/Xpedition)
* Eagle (Autodesk)
