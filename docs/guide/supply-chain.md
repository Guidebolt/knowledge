## Notes

Ideally you want to find good local suppliers and commit to them. The closer your supply chain, the lower your transport risk and associated losses (shipping, import fees, FOREX, legal, coordination).

We maintain a living document called a supply-chain index. It is a spreadsheet file that contains all companies that we are aware of. Trusted companies are marked QVL (qualified vendor list). A dedicated QVL PDF is exported regularly (ex. quarterly) for easy reference.
