# Meta, Communication

Last Updated: 2021-03-22

The purpose of this guide is to clarify the fundamental ideas required for efficient communication.

What is efficient communication?

* Faster symbol processing
* Complete comprehension of intended ideas
* Deeper second-order idea connections
* Correct mapping to useful/actionable personal-relevance

## Ideas and Symbols

What is an idea?

An idea is a mental representation or model of reality.

It is a meaningful fragment of information.

It is the interpretation of something.

It can be abstract or concrete, real or imaginary.

What is a symbol?

A symbol is a physical representation of an idea.

A symbol is observed then interpreted as an idea.

Symbols are usually a compact pattern of distinct, standardized elements (ex. alphabet) constrained by a communication method (ex. writing, speaking).

Symbols connect to ideas through the interpretation-logic of the observer.

Symbols are usually defined universally (common words) for repeated use across a community, but they can be defined for single-use (ex. temporary codenames).

Symbols can express ideas that are unintended, ambiguous, incomplete, ... Be careful.

This is the communication sequence.

I think ideas to ideas. I connect ideas to symbols. I write those symbols.

You read those symbols. You connect symbols to ideas. You think ideas to ideas.

## Quality and Understanding

## Text and Keywords

Text is an effective category of symbols.

Text is compact. It requires less data-size (per idea) than pictures, videos, and audio clips. It can be written quickly.

Text is portable. It can be copy/pasted quickly and easily.

Text is compatible. It can be written with a simple pen or standard keyboard. It can be conveyed by vision, audio, and touch (ex. braille) in various ways (ex. books, websites).

---

Keywords are textual words and phrases that convey an important idea.

Example, "from" is a normal word, "energy" is a keyword.

## Our Communication Standard

### Fast Comma

We like using the comma for concise sentences that retain clear separation of ideas. Example, this sentence. Flow worse, speed/size better.

### Unity Dash

We like using dash-symbols to clearly communicate the unity of multiple words to mean a single idea. Especially valuable for clarity in complex or otherwise-ambiguous sentences.

### One Idea, One Word

Diverse words offer nuance and reader-engagement (ex. marvelous, magnificent, incredible), but we prefer a functional focus. The goal is compact vocabulary with major functional differences in the idea-keyword pairs.

So we use idea-keyword maps like this:

* Absolute Good, Neutral: Ok
* Absolute Good, Positive1: Good
* Absolute Good, Positive2: Great
* Comparative Good: Better
* Highest-Available Good: Best
* Highest-Possible Good: Perfect
* Highest-Imaginable Good: Ideal

We prefer keywords that are quick (low letter count, low syllable count) and clear (unique spelling/sound from other words, understandable-at-a-glimpse).

### One Idea, One Combo

We like basic-keywords and their short-combinations over new words with low-marginal-meaning. Example, words like "beautiful" and "handsome" are all replaced by "looks good".

### Dense Lines

We like efficient sentences packed with important ideas and spaced across short paragraphs.

## Idea Toolbox

There exists a subconscious toolbox of ideas (and their respective keywords) that one accumulates through their mastery of a language.

Just as the general-learning-curve combines familiar ideas to understand new ones, the most basic keywords are the ingredients to complex ideas and mental-models.

Conscious consideration of the basic toolbox supports to-the-point communication and sharper idea-to-idea awareness.

Practical1:

* What happened? Tell me the good news then the bad news.
* This option has better reliability and worse ergonomics.
* I think the best plan is to stay here for tonight.

Basic ideas often exist as sets of 3. Within a 3-set, one idea has absolute meaning and forms a spectrum for the other two to mean opposing directions. Example, temperature-hotter-colder.

Basic 3-sets can substitute the opposing-direction idea-pair with a contextual-value idea-pair. Example, texture-smooth-rough. The range of values for smooth/rough are relative, therefore dependent on context (general human touch vs precision machine friction).

## Controlled Vocabulary

A controlled vocabulary is a list of standard keywords typically used to simplify knowledge-management processes such as tagging and searching. Furthermore, it offers better clarity for the reading experience but causes repetition that worsens nuance/engagement.

Without a controlled vocabulary, knowledge-management is complex and error-prone with needlessly scattered or ambiguous words such as with synonyms and homonyms. For example, suppose you search your files for a certain document using the "NOTES" tag, but unable to find it because it was actually tagged with the word "ESSAY" instead.

For example, we like simple keywords for goodness. 

* GOOD, NEUTRAL, BAD
* BETTER, WORST
* BEST, WORST
