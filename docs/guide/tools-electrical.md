## Soldering Station

PACE, ADS200 Accudrive with Instant Setback Cubby

* 120W
* thermal tips

ORDERING ID: 8007-0579

We like the chisel and mini-wave tips.

## Solder Wire

TESTING: KESTER, 268 Series, Lead-Free (Halogen Free, No-Clean)

This has most of what we want but is not rated for cleaning with IPA.

We recommend the following solder-wire characteristics:

* SAC305 solder alloy (lead-free)
* low-activity no-halogen flux (category L0)
* no-clean flux, but cleanable with IPA

Solder-wire is normally thermally-stable.

## Solder Paste

PCB assembly with solder-paste can be very efficient if you have good tools for paste dispensing, part pick-and-place, and thermal reflow. 

We recommend the following solder-paste characteristics:

* SAC305 solder alloy (lead-free)
* thermally-stable (no refrigeration/warm-up required)
* low-activity no-halogen flux (category L0)
* no-clean flux, but cleanable with IPA

TESTING: CHIPQUIK, solder-paste no-fridge lead-free no-clean SAC305

ORDERING ID: TS391SNL250 (250 GRAM, JAR)

ORDERING ID: TS391SNL500C (500 GRAM, SYRINGE)

## Flux

We strongly recommend flux that is low-copper-penetration halogen-free composition for safety. This is marked "L0" as specified by ANSI/J-STD-004.

## Fume Extractor

PACE, ARM-EVAC 150 with SteadyFlex Arm and Nozzle Assembly

ORDERING ID: 8889-0150-P1

## Hot Air Rework Station

QUICK, 861DW

* as recommended by EEVlog and Louis-Rossman
* dual-unit (supports both C and F units; hold CH2 and CH3 to switch)

## Work Plate

ALPHIDIA, Quadhands Jumbo Workbench (Powder-coated Steel, Magnetic-Base Flex-Holders)

## Microscope

AMSCOPE, 7X-45X Simul-Focal Stereo Lockable Zoom Microscope on Dual Arm Boom Stand

* stereo (3D vision)
* camera port
* simul-focal (concurrent use of stereo-view and camera-port)
* variable zoom and zoom lock
* metal levers
