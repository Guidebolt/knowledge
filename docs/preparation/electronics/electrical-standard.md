# Guidebolt Electrical Design Standard

2020-07-13

## Reliability Standard

All circuit parts should be automotive-grade (AEC-Q).

## Composition

All parts must be RoHS compliant.

All parts should be halogen free.

Note that "X-Free" generally allows trace amounts below a standard threshold. For example, "halogen-free" and "zero halogen" are typically used interchangeably under the max 1500ppm of total halogens (IEC 61249-2-21).

## Temperature

All circuit parts must be capable of operation and storage in -40C to 105C (or better).

## PCB Fabrication

All PCBs must be fabricated to IPC Class 2 (or better).

All PCBs must have rounded corners.

All PCBs must use ENIG surface finish (or better).

All PCBs must have silkscreen text.

Sensitive-signal PCBs must be fabricated with impedance control.

All PCB soldermask should be green.

All PCBs should have thermal conductivity of 0.4W/mK (or better).

## PCB Text

All PCBs must have the following text:

* reference designator (one per circuit part)
* functional pin name (one per external pin)
* company name
* design ID (with revision number)
* date of manufacture (YYYY-MM-DD format)
* batch number
* serial number

## PCB Mounting

All PCBs should have 4 or more mounting holes.

All PCB mounting holes must support metric screws.

All PCB mounting holes should be patterned as a rectangle.

## PCB Protection

Moisture-expected PCBs must have conformal-coating or encapsulation.

## Flame Resistance

All power-connectors and power-ICs must be UL94-V0.

All power-connectors should be glow-wire-capable.

## Transient Protection

All external pins must have transient voltage protection.

## Module Lifetime

All electrical modules must have at least 50K hours MTBF.

All electrical modules should have at least 150K hours MTBF.

## Capacitors

All low-value capacitors should be MLCC.

General-use low-value capacitors should have soft-terminated ends.

All medium-value capacitors should be aluminum-polymer.
