## Truth and Preparation

**Truth is reality in its past, present, and future.** What has been, what is, what could be, and what will be. The world's continuous transition from its now-state to its next-state as structured by the complex patterns of cause-and-effect. A perfectly accurate understanding of change at any scale or perspective.

**Truth helps prepare the best possible action.** With clarity, ideals settle for possibilities. With realism, ideals ground to the specific experiences of all entities across all time. With accuracy, a clearly-and-specifically considered intent maps correctly to its thread of present-to-future.

**Preparation is the completion of good truths.** In practice, the full truth of everything is always learned incompletely in pieces. Good truths improve the path, bad truths worsen the path, irrelevant truths make no difference, and non-truths can cause whatever. Some combination of good truths always points to the perfect path; the sufficient collection of good truths for equivalently perfect guidance, at least for a moment, as if possessing the full truth.

## Efficient Thinking

**Every thought and observation should improve your satisfaction or decision-making.** Anything that improves neither is unnecessary/incidental noise.

## Guiding Ideas

* **Continuous Risk**: Stay careful. Something can go wrong at anytime. 
* **Reversibility**: Prefer decisions with reversible consequences.
* **Proportional Consideration**: Spend more time thinking and getting feedback on more important decisions.
* **Possibility Over Probability**: Brainstorm and prepare for all normal and abnormal possibilities, especially for high-stakes situations. 
* **Resilient Value**: Prefer resources that continue to produce useful value even after plans and circumstances change.
* **Clear Expectations**: Communicate what you want. Plan and agree to what should happen when something goes wrong, before something goes wrong.
* **Rational Vigilance**: Routinely question what you are doing and why you are doing it.
* **Completion**: Finish what you start, start only what you will finish, and stop what is not worth finishing.
* **Optimization**: Routinely seek a better outcome or process.
* **Balanced Rationality**: Stay sharp enough to cut through weak ideas. Stay soft enough to absorb unfamiliar truths.
* **Rational Self-Control**: Be able to actually do what you know is the best path.
* **Time Efficiency**: Perform every task with quality and speed, striving to do the best you can with the time you have.
* **Useful Learning**: Learn with purpose, towards some fundamental combination of mental satisfaction and valuable action. Decide which beliefs you are happy to hold or driven to refine.
* **Fundamental Understanding**: Master the basics. Deep knowledge is rooted in the truest understanding of the most elementary ideas.
* **Incremental Improvement**: Skill growth can occur in small steps.
* **Comfortable Expertise**: Master skills enough to perform superbly with ease.
* **Scientific Intuition**: Learn ideas deeply enough to be able to think about their conceptual and numerical approximations naturally.
* **True Causality**: Know what truly causes what. Seemingly small decisions can have actually big consequences and seemingly big decisions can have actually small consequences.
* **First-Time Excellence**: Do it right the first time. Avoid the frustration and sunk cost of incurring even a single major problem.
* **Convenient Action**: Set up your tasks to be easier to do and they are more likely to get done.
* **Steady Action**: Move cautiously to avoid unintended injuries and damage. Slowly signal your action before committing fully.
* **Timing**: Act at the right time and in the right order.
* **Sampling**: Try one before committing to more.
* **Batching**: Do many at once. Leverage economies of scale. Accomplish many goals in one smooth sequence.
* **Absolute-Comparative Clarity**: Sometimes it is easier to determine the better of two than the quality of one. Or the reverse.
