## Small Parts Storage

PORTABLE LABEL PRINTER: BRADY, BMP21-PLUS (AA batteries) (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

Create time-saving labels faster with better clarity, consistency, durability than hand-writing or non-portable printing.

ORDERING ID: BRADY, 139535

STANDARD: Transparent Slider Bags (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

Light-weight, compact (conforms to contents), fast-identify, fast open/close.

We've tried different sizes. Too small and the bags are slow because we can't reach in with a full hand and the top is more rigid. Too big and the bags are slow because more distance to slide-open/close, plus harder to fit in compact containers; but big bags can contain smaller bags nicely.

SIZE: 200mm X 175mm (8in X 7in) (great for standard use) (RECOMMENDED)

SIZE: 16in X 12in (intended to fit several smaller bags for categorized organization. fits inside a typical large plastic/kraft storage box)

SOLDER WIRE

TESTING: KESTER, 268 Series, Lead-Free (Halogen Free, No-Clean)

This has most of what we want but is not rated for cleaning with IPA.

We recommend the following solder-wire characteristics:

* SAC305 solder alloy (lead-free)
* low-activity no-halogen flux (category L0)
* no-clean flux, but cleanable with IPA

Solder-wire is normally thermally-stable.

SOLDER PASTE

PCB assembly with solder-paste can be very efficient if you have good tools for paste dispensing, part pick-and-place, and thermal reflow. 

We recommend the following solder-paste characteristics:

* SAC305 solder alloy (lead-free)
* thermally-stable (no refrigeration/warm-up required)
* low-activity no-halogen flux (category L0)
* no-clean flux, but cleanable with IPA

TESTING: CHIPQUIK, solder-paste no-fridge lead-free no-clean SAC305

ORDERING ID: TS391SNL250 (250 GRAM, JAR)

ORDERING ID: TS391SNL500C (500 GRAM, SYRINGE)

FLUX

We strongly recommend flux that is low-copper-penetration halogen-free composition for safety. This is marked "L0" as specified by ANSI/J-STD-004.

## Fluid Dispenser Accessories

[PRODUCT PAGE](https://www.nordson.com/en/divisions/efd/products/fluid-dispensing-systems/ultimusplus-i-ii-dispensers)

Note: We mainly use this to dispense solder paste and sometimes liquid-adhesive/potting compound. Includes a foot pedal for efficient/accurate manual dispensing. Instead of the touchscreen we prefer to use a wireless mouse (LOGITECH, M190). Use 80+ psi for fine gauge dispensing of solder paste; use steady mode for start-of-session purging (as noted in quick-start guide).

ACCESSORIES:

* 30cc adapter assembly, 0.9m (O-ID: 7012338)
* 30cc syringe barrel and piston, 20-pack (O-ID, 7012136)
* end cap, 20-pack (O-ID, 7012196)
* tip cap, pack (O-ID, 7012198)
* free dispensing tip kit

## Electrical Accessories

USB-C CABLE: ANKER, Powerline 3 USB-C to USB-C (white, 10ft) (female to female)

Quality: Commercial, High

* 60W max power
* 480Mbps max speed (USB2 datarate)

## Medium Storage

Mailer Boxes

Boxes offer good stackability and hard shell protection as a low-cost rigid part container. Mailer boxes add quick, tool-free reclosable convenience.

Hard Cases

## Hard Organizers

MILWAUKEE, Packout Series - [Product Info](https://www.milwaukeetool.com/Products/Storage-Solutions/PACKOUT)

(RECOMMENDED)

The most time-efficient small-parts organizer that we know. Semi-transparent top, durable frame, removable subcontainers, quiet and ergonomic latches. 

Low Profile Organizer (ORDERING ID: MILWAUKEE, 48-22-8431) 

Standard Organizer (ORDERING ID: MILWAUKEE, 48-22-8430)

Deep Organizer (ORDERING ID: MILWAUKEE, 48-22-8432)

Mounting Plate (ORDERING ID: MILWAUKEE, 48-22-8485)

Ever since we discovered that these containers can be stacked then opened individually WITHOUT unstacking them, they have become an efficient, compact, regularly-used part of our small-parts strategy.

* For fastest multi-access, take out the desired subcontainers from the main-containers and place on table. Return the subcontainers to the main-containers when the heavy-access period is finished. 
* For faster access, stack all main-containers vertically with the bottom mounted to a fixed surface and leave all latches open. Set a backwall such that all main-containers can be opened for access yet cannot be opened to the point the top containers would start to scatter their parts.
* For fast access, stack and bottom-mount the same as above but close 1 or both latches for a secure hold (no protective backwall required).
