## Cost-Effective Common

### Work Table

HUSKY, HOLT46XDB12CA (24x46 inch) (DISTR: Home Depot) (white model is $238 USD) (STRONG RCMD)

Sturdy simple wooden tabletop with steel legs (painted black or white) and adjustable-height crank (manually operated). Requires assembly with M6 screws (included). Also comes with 4x lockable swivel casters and 4x feet. Bottom support bar can be mounted in the center or front/rear. This is the smallest length model and we prefer it compared to the longer sizes that are harder to transport.

### Light-Duty Shelf

Tuff Store, 72in x 36in black plastic shelf (model: 1918555) (DISTR: Home Depot) ($45 CAD) (RCMD)

Fast assembly/disassembly, light-weight, 70kg max load per shelf and 340kg max load total (when evenly distributed), Made in Canada.

### Small Plastic Bin

Tuff Store (transparent, 5.76L capacity, Made in Canada) (clear lid model: 94210) (grey lid 4-pack model: 942110) (blue lid 4-pack model: 942109)  ($2 CAD each, $7 for 4) (RCMD)

12 of these bins can fit on each level of the light-duty shelf above.

### Label Printer

BRADY, M210 (formerly BMP21-PLUS) (ordering ID: 139535) (STRONG RCMD)

Create time-saving labels faster with better clarity, consistency, durability than hand-writing or non-portable printing. Perfect complement to storage bags and boxes. Portable size and runs on AA batteries.

Preferred Labels: 12.7mm wide Vinyl or Nylon (ex. 4-pack vinyl ordering ID: M21-500-595-WT-4PK) 

### Slider Bags

Transparent Slider Bags: HEFTY, 8x7-2.7mil (STRONG RCMD) (200mm X 175mm / 8" x 7") ($63 USD per 250 bags)

Compact, conforming to contents. Big enough to fit your hand. Fast-identify and fast-open/close. Do not buy any of the smaller sizes. We have used thousands of these bags over the years.

## Mechanical Design

This workflow starts with a **3D modeling program**. The free and open-source option is [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) but it's not efficient yet for professional use. We use [Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview). 

Using this program, we digitally produce parts, assemblies, and drawings.

Windows (OS) -> Autodesk Inventor (CAD) -> 3D Model

... Export STL File -> Cura (CAM) -> Gcode file (on USB Drive) -> 3D Printer -> **Additive Plastic Parts (up to 0.1mm precision)**
