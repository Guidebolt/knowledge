# Intro

## Comprehensive Scope

The content on this knowledge-base is limited to our understanding and experience as a company (what we know, consider, or use). For example, because we are based in Canada, we generally only mention suppliers that serve our locations in Canada. 

## Explicit Recommendations

When we like the quality of something (product, service, resource), we will tag the info with "recommended" or "strongly recommended", for what meets and exceeds our standards, respectively.

Any item without a recommendation tag has absolutely no assurance of goodness from us. This is because sometimes we try something basic to build intuition about what makes something good. Sometimes we do not have time to research towards something great, so we settle for something ok. Sometimes we get something that we think is good then.. we realize it is not good. We know that the tool/part/material selection process can be extremely time-consuming and mistake-expensive. Rely on us to guide your research-to-commitment process through clear and confident suggestions for proven quality.

## Document Access

Some documents that we mention or link to are paywalled or otherwise hard-to-access. In these cases, try searching for the document-of-interest at an archive-website and you may be able to find old-versions, snippets, or related-documents for free!

## Story-Reference Spectrum of Knowledge

The use of all useful information happens on a story-reference spectrum. Story info is like a good book. It offers a smooth reading experience to improve your understanding of something. It is generally intended to be read once from start-to-finish then retained. Reference info is like a good chart. It offers the fastest path to specific ideas (ex. equations, standard numbers) to help you do something immediately. It is generally intended to be accessed repeatedly for just the required info per situational need then forgotten.

Therefore.. 

If you want to learn, seek story guides.

If you want to find keywords and quick answers now (or know where to look for them later), seek reference guides.
