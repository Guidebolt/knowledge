# Introduction

Welcome, reader.

Please note that the contents of this knowledge-base are limited to our experience as a company based in Canada.

**For easier access to mentioned/linked documents** that are paywalled or unavailable, search for free snippets, related-documents, and old-versions at one of the online archive websites listed on the main page. 

**Our explicit recommendations** are tagged as "recommended" or "strongly recommended". Untagged resources have no assurance of goodness from us because sometimes:

* we try something basic to build intuition about what makes something good
* we settle for something ok because we have no time to search for something great
* we get something that we think is good then... we realize it is not good

The tool/part/material selection process can be extremely time-consuming and mistake-expensive. Rely on us to guide your decisions. 

**To learn for understanding,** seek knowledge that is generally intended to be read once from start-to-finish then retained (story type). Ideally, such knowledge offers a smooth reading experience with a well-sequenced learning curve.

**To complete a task,** seek knowledge that is generally intended to be accessed repeatedly for just the required ideas/details then forgotten after use (reference type). Ideally, such knowledge offers the fastest path to specific ideas (ex. equations, standard numbers) with immediate decision-making/actionable value.

This duality is the story-reference spectrum of knowledge.
