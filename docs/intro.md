# Introduction

Welcome, reader.

**What**: This is a curated knowledge base with technical focus on how to design and build excellent systems. Its principles are:

1. **Completeness**: provide knowledge with less gaps as required to learn and do properly
2. **Convenience**: be a single place for multiple links to the great knowledge out there
3. **Concise**: enable fast paths to desired knowledge with minimal noise and high content density
4. **Cohesion**: present knowledge purposefully for an intuitive and useful experience

**Why**: Based on our first-hand frustrations with the modern landscape of knowledge, we want others to have an easier time.

* Search engines are demanding (user-dependent search query) and noisy (low-quality links).
* Encyclopedias are descriptive and more navigation-friendly but lack depth and instruction.
* Forums are relatively slow but suited for intermediate-to-advanced discussion while newbies are commonly linked to prepared tutorials for the basics.
* Consulting with trusted experts can yield good fast answers (still a bit request-dependent) but does not scale easily.
* Prepared courses are fundamentally a curated book/video/worksheet sequence with diluted consulting (ex. Q&A/homework/exams) for a structured hybrid experience with some efficiency/flexibility tradeoffs.

The ideal experience exists on a spectrum between a **real-time course** generated on-demand uniquely for the user's need and a **universal book** providing an index to explore all topics at all depths (theory/instruction/practice) without specifying any need (but can be optimized by one). Understanding the ideal helps design a good real.

## As the Reader

Generally, you want to read fast while retaining reading comprehension. Sometimes you want to stop or slow-down not because comprehension is challenging but because you want to reflect on the ideas and think by yourself for a bit.

Functionally (aside from engagement/entertainment), you are here to either **improve your expertise** (skills) or **get something done** (task). The benefit of a consuming a given piece of information can be factored as:

1. **Relevance Schedule**: All future points in time when it will help you.
2. **Practical Versatility**: How many unique, useful categories of tasks that it can help you with.
3. **Marginal Value**: How much better of a decision that you will make with it compared to without.

Some topics are good to learn **generally** (basics, main subtopics) yet bad to learn in certain **specific aspects**. For example, the benefit of learning basic-to-intermediate English is excellent (in all 3 categories). In contrast, the benefit of learning very uncommon English vocabulary is poor. 

Some information is best experienced **once from start-to-finish then retained forever (story method)**. Ideally, you get a smooth learning curve with easy-flowing content and you never need to repeat the experience.

Some information is best experienced **repeatedly for particular details as required/forgotten (reference method)**. Ideally, you retain the knowledge for a temporary period of need (ex. 3 days of a hotel door passcode) but there is no pressure to retain it (ex. passcode is on the hotel card inside your wallet). Other examples include math equation/number sheets and dictionaries for immediate meaningful value.

## Examples

This introduction is intended to be read once then never again.

The [Main Page](/) starts like a story then shifts into 2 major reference sections: [Common](/#common) (a list of quick links to frequently used resources; similar to browser bookmarks) and [Companies](/#companies) (a list of some companies that either we have done business with directly/indirectly or we are interested in). Because the main page naturally has the highest accessibility on this website, it's the most efficient place for reference content.

## Assorted

**For easier access to mentioned/linked documents** that are paywalled or unavailable, search for free snippets, related-documents, and old-versions at one of the online archive websites listed on the main page. 

**Our explicit recommendations** are tagged as "recommended" or "strongly recommended". Untagged resources have no assurance of goodness from us because sometimes:

* we try something basic to build intuition about what makes something good
* we settle for something ok because we have no time to search for something great
* we get something that we think is good then... we realize it is not good

The tool/part/material selection process can be extremely time-consuming and mistake-expensive. Rely on us to guide your decisions. 

Some information is limited to our experience as a Canadian company.
