# Intro

Goal: Increase the useful value that you get from this knowledge-base.

## Explicit Recommendations

When we like the quality of something (product, service, resource), we will tag the info with "recommended" or "strongly recommended", for what meets and exceeds our standards, respectively.

Any item without a recommendation tag has absolutely no assurance of goodness from us. This is because sometimes we try something basic to build intuition about what makes something good. Sometimes we do not have time to research towards something great, so we settle for something ok. Sometimes we get something that we think is good then.. we realize it is not good. We know that the tool/part/material selection process can be extremely time-consuming and mistake-expensive. Rely on us to guide your procurement process through clear and confident suggestions for proven quality.
