What do you want?

The information on this page is from our perspective as a Canadian business. Your country may have different rules and opportunities so some information may not be fully applicable to your situation.

## Common Guide Structure

Most guides follow a similar structure. Generally, more versatile content belongs at the top. 

**Resources** are external links to third-party websites, documents, and multimedia with particularly versatile or strong value.

For example, "Electrical Design" points to a "Thermal Intuition" resource will improve the thermal design quality of all future PCB projects.

**Other Resources** address more situational needs.
