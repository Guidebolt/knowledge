## SHIPPING

We love shipping companies that save us time. We do not want to spend hours calling customer support or driving to a warehouse or waiting in-line or investigating payment errors.

DHL (our favorite) (the best cross-border shipping experiences we have had, due to their time-efficient online interface) (no domestic service, at least in Canada that we know of)

UPS (same-day shipping available via UPS Express Critical, good customer support, recently launched a simple-ship interface for normal-expedited services)

Purolator (drivers show up on time)

Canada Post (balanced back-up option)

Fedex (enough issues in the past so we do not proactively use them currently, but most of the time have good incoming shipments from other vendors)

## TELECOM

[TEKSAVVY](https://www.teksavvy.com/)

One of the only pro-consumer telcos in Canada, actively trying to reduce prices while improving service.

[FREEDOM MOBILE CANADA](https://www.freedommobile.ca/en-CA)

Good value prepaid plans. We like the 179 CAD/year (15/mth) for unlimited nationwide calling/texting and 5GB/yr.

## Notes

Find good local suppliers and commit to them. Lowest transport risk and associated losses (language barriers, shipping, import fees, FOREX, legal, leadtime coordination).
