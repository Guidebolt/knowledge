## Maintenance

Annually, a federal corporation must file a [corporate return with Corporations Canada](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cd-dgc.nsf/eng/cs07016.html).

Annually, a federal corporation must prepare financial statements (balance sheet, income statement) then file a [corporate tax return with the Canada Revenue Agency](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/corporations/corporation-income-tax-return.html).
