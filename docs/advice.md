# Advice

The center of all possible advice funnels into the skill of how you spend your time. In practice, how you make decisions and control your feelings. Ultimately, how you nudge the future and experience your life.

## Guiding Ideas

### Efficient Thinking

Think only about ideas that steer your life in a better direction (learn/enjoy/accomplish). Thinking about anything that does not is a waste of time.

### Durable Benefits

Prefer things that continue to be useful even after plans and circumstances change.

This is an important part of purchasing wisdom.

### Continuous Risk

Stay careful. Something can go wrong at anytime.

### Current Task Awareness

Routinely question (every 1min, 5min, or 30min) what you are currently doing in terms of its:

* expected completion time
* current productivity relative to past productivity and target productivity
* alternative approaches to thinking/performing the task
* importance- in what way does it progress you towards your goals
* opportunity cost against alternative tasks

### Reversibility

Prefer decisions with reversible consequences.

### Proportional Consideration

Spend more time thinking and getting feedback on more important decisions.

### Possibility Over Probability

High-stakes situations require preparation for all possibilities, not just the likely probabilities.

### Correct X for Y

Use the correct tools for the job. Use the correct parts for the job. Assign the correct people for the project/task. Consider the correct approach to the problem. Consider the correct idea for the question. Think from the correct perspective for the situation. Establish the correct design for the application.

### Full Utilization

Fully leverage existing resources, especially non-consumables such as durable tools and skills. 

### Clear Expectations

Communicate what you want. Plan and agree to what should happen when something goes wrong, before something goes wrong.

### Completion

Finish what you start, start only what you will finish, and stop what is not worth finishing.

### Optimization

Routinely seek a better outcome or process.

### Balanced Rationality

Stay sharp enough to cut through weak ideas. Stay soft enough to absorb unfamiliar truths.

### Rational Self-Control

Be able to actually do what you know is the best path.

### Time Efficiency

Perform every task with quality and speed, striving to do the best you can with the time you have.

### Useful Learning

Learn with purpose, towards some fundamental combination of mental satisfaction and valuable action. Decide which beliefs you are happy to hold or driven to refine.

### Fundamental Understanding

Master the basics. Deep knowledge is rooted in the truest understanding of the most elementary ideas.

### Incremental Improvement

Skill growth can occur in small steps.

### Comfortable Expertise

Master skills enough to perform superbly with ease.

### Scientific Intuition

Learn ideas deeply enough to be able to think about their conceptual and numerical approximations naturally.

### True Causality

Know what truly causes what. Seemingly small decisions can have actually big consequences and seemingly big decisions can have actually small consequences.

### First-Time Excellence

Do it right the first time. Avoid the frustration and sunk cost of incurring even a single major problem.

### Convenient Preparation

Set up your tasks to be easier to do and they are more likely to get done.

### Steady Action

Move cautiously to avoid unintended injuries and damage. Slowly signal your action before committing fully.

### Timing

Act at the right time and in the right order.

### Sampling

Try one before committing to more.

### Batching

Do many at once. Leverage economies of scale. Accomplish many goals in one smooth sequence.

### Absolute-Comparative Clarity

Sometimes it is easier to determine the better of two than the quality of one. Sometimes it is easier to determine the quality of one than the better of two.

## Truth and Preparation

**Truth is reality in its past, present, and future.** What has been, what is, what could be, and what will be. The world's continuous transition from its now-state to its next-state as structured by the complex patterns of cause-and-effect. A perfectly accurate understanding of change at any scale or perspective.

**Truth is balanced between its cost and the complex nature of its guidance.** Truths cost time (to read/watch/listen/think) that weighs against their value. With clarity, ideals settle for possibilities. With realism, ideals ground to the specific experiences of all entities across all time. With accuracy, a clear and specific intent maps correctly to its thread of present-to-future.

**Preparation is the completion of good truths.** Perfect truth and logic certainly yields the best path, yet, in practice, the truth is learned in incomplete pieces. Incomplete truths open the possibility of being misled by the truth, even with perfect logic; therefore a useful classification is that good truths improve your path, bad truths worsen your path, and irrelevant truths make no difference, while non-truths can go either way. Because some combination of good truths can point to the same decision as knowing the perfect truth, reaching such best-decision equivalence with only a fraction of the perfect truth can be considered "the completion of good truths". Ideally, this completion is efficient as possible with the easiest, fastest, smallest set of good truths.
