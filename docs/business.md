## Old Notes

**Commercial General Liability (CGL) Insurance**: Protects against third-party injury and property damage claims. Benefit is significant risk reduction of the business having to directly pay a typical $100K to $1M legal settlement. 

**Data Backup Schedule and Reliable Data System**: Prevents data loss and business disruption caused by drive failure, human error, indirect damage (ex. fire), and special data problems (ex. bitrot). Benefit is significant risk reduction of a variable $10K to $1M+ business disruption cost (depends on business size and data-dependency). 

**Data Security Policy**: Protects against typical brute-force, phishing, and social-engineering attacks. Benefit is significant risk reduction of a typical $1M+ ransomware settlement, reputation damage, and business disruption.

Typical business scope:

* Sales, Marketing, Support (public engagement)
* Operations, Engineering, Project Management (product-service focus)
* Accounting/Finance, Human Resources, Legal, Security (resource accumulation/protection)
* Strategy (planning/direction leadership)

Key questions:

* What is the long-term strategy?
* What makes the product/service compelling?
* What is strong about the product-market fit?

Key planning ideas:

* Prepare for market saturation.
* Focus on significant upgrades (ex. air conditioning inside cars).
