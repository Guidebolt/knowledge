## General Recommendations

[Input Tax Credits](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/gst-hst-businesses/complete-file-input-tax-credit.html): GST/HST paid on business expenses become fully refundable tax credits. Benefit is 5% to 15% savings depending on which provinces you mainly purchase from. Import GST is also eligible.

**Commercial General Liability (CGL) Insurance**: Protects against third-party injury and property damage claims. Benefit is significant risk reduction of the business having to directly pay a typical $100K to $1M legal settlement. 

**Data Backup Schedule and Reliable Data System**: Prevents data loss and business disruption caused by drive failure, human error, indirect damage (ex. fire), and special data problems (ex. bitrot). Benefit is significant risk reduction of a variable $10K to $1M+ business disruption cost (depends on business size and data-dependency). 

**Data Security Policy**: Protects against typical brute-force, phishing, and social-engineering attacks. Benefit is significant risk reduction of a typical $1M+ ransomware settlement, reputation damage, and business disruption.
