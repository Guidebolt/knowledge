This is the Guidebolt Public Knowledge Base. It is a free information resource for your benefit. It contains a small fraction of our private records based on our experience as a company. It purposes to teach the efficient truth with a technical focus for you to understand the world and get things done correctly.

For fast actionable value, explore the **Tools** folder. Our confident suggestions are explicitly labeled "recommended" and "strongly recommended", for what meets and exceeds our standard of resilient value after thorough evaluation. We understand how time-consuming and mistake-expensive the selection process can be. Rely on us to guide your procurement of quality tools, parts, and materials.

For abstract foundational knowledge, see [Knowledge Theory](/meta/knowledge-theory) and [General Principles](/system/general-principles). We highly value meta-learning to improve the accuracy and speed of critical thinking with incredible versatility.
