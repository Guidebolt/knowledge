# Introduction

This is the Guidebolt Public Knowledge Base.

It is a free information resource for your benefit.

It contains a small fraction of our private records based on our experience as a company.

It purposes to teach the efficient truth for engineers, entrepreneurs, researchers, and similar decision-makers.

## Truth

Information drives every thought, decision, and action. In our increasingly complex world where logic and trust are hard to weave confidently, it is easy to be misled by noise, incur unknown risks, and waste valuable resources. Truth is the fundamental solution.

Truth is reality in its past, present, and future. What has been, what is, what could be, and what will be. Truth is the immediate state of the world and the complex patterns of cause-and-effect that structure the specific dynamics of change. 

Truth is the most accurate understanding of reality. With accuracy, one projects their best possible power towards intended results. With realism, one maps abstract ideals to actual, granular possibilities.

Truth is learned as true information flows into correct interpretation. Truth is understood in pieces. Truths vary in value. The value of a truth based on how quickly it can be learned, how it changes the future, and how it changes the experience between the present and that future.

Filter truth from information.

## Preparation

Truth prepares action. Truth prepares the mind to perform the best available action. For every situation, the relevant truths always point to the optimal solution.

Preparation involves knowledge and logic. Preparation is best done in logical sequence (learning curve). Preparation requires truthful internal processing (critical thinking). Preparation is expanded and accelerated through truthful external resources (observable information).

Preparing truth takes time. Time is limited within all finite schedules. Therefore one should pursue and prepare only the most useful truths in the most efficient order of timely relevance and safe versatility.

The value of preparation relates to the useful frequency, timing, and significance of its truths. Truths can be useful once, multiple times, or continuously. Useful now, soon, later, short-term, long-term, or not at all. Useful to low, medium, or high importance.

* One learns a common language to interpret useful information across a lifetime (continuous, long-term, high)
* One reads a unique verification number to authorize a login (single, immediate, low)
* One references a math formula sheet to complete a building safety calculation (multiple, immediate, high)
* One learns about key car quality factors before evaluating different cars for a purchase (single, short-term, medium)
* One remembers the serial number of their refrigerator but never uses it (multiple, none, low)

Note:

* The value of a truth (ex. understanding a language) can be indirect from the action (ex. apply language to read a useful idea, then apply that idea for improved action).
* The useful schedule of a truth can vary not only from the fluctuations of need (ex. verification number only required when logging in) but also through the impermanence of the truth itself (ex. verification number always changes across attempts).
* The timing of using a particular truth (ex. math formula for safety calculation) can be different from the critical timing of its value (ex. building experiences earthquake).
* The value of a truth (ex. car quality factors) can sometimes be guiding the valuation of other truths (ex. focus on key information areas when evaluating a car).
* The low value of a small truth (ex. refrigerator serial number) exemplifies the granularity of truth and guides the improvement of prepared information by evaluating its efficiency in small, discrete increments (value per second, value per word).

Preparation involves the storage of truths. Storage can be internal (in memory) or external (in observable, accessible records). On risk, both internal and external storage can be degraded or lost (ex. forgetting, bitrot, concussion, drive failure). Fortunately, external storage is generally reliable when stored on quality drives and backed up; internal storage is generally reliable for storing conceptual truths. On performance, external storage incurs pointer cost (know when which external stores are most relevant), access costs (navigation time and re-interpretation processing), and internal opportunity cost (externally stored truths cannot be subconsciously processed internally). Fortunately, data organization and efficiency can be designed and skilled to excellence; critical thinking can help integrate key truths from information after interpreting it just once.

The basic model of preparation is a broad, deep toolbox of knowledge that supports a fast, rigorous engine of logic. Advanced models include combinations of knowledge, logic, body coordination, and muscle memory to define as skills. General categories include concept skills (understand interactive and relational ideas, ex. gravity and buoyancy), calculation skills (solve equations and define details), and tool skills (ex. know how to use a particular program's GUI).

In practice, an important step for efficient preparation is the separation of learning information from reference information. Learning info should be consumed once, absorbed intuitively, reviewed rarely, and designed to improve mental models broad and deep. Reference info should be reused, refined concisely (assume background knowledge), organized accessibly (fast!), and designed to solve immediate problems just-in-time.

## Using This Resource

We expend great effort to create resilient designs, procure quality tools, establish sensible standards, and find dependable suppliers. That said, we are always testing new technologies and using sufficient technologies based on new recent products and limited immediate options. Therefore we explicitly label our confident suggestions as "recommended" and "strongly recommended", for what meets and exceeds our standard of resilient value after thorough evaluation. That said, remember that your needs may overlap with ours in different ways, so we still advise careful consideration.
