# Overview

Last Updated: 2020-04-12

This is the Guidebolt Public Knowledge Base.

It is a free resource for your benefit.

It contains a small fraction of our private records.

It purposes to teach the efficient truth for engineers, entrepreneurs, researchers, and similar decision-makers.

## Truth

Information drives every thought, decision, and action. In our increasingly complex world where logic and trust are hard to weave confidently, it is easy to be misled by noise, incur unknown risks, and waste valuable resources. Truth is the fundamental solution.

Truth is reality in its past, present, and future. What has been, what is, what could be, and what will be. Truth is the immediate state of the world and the complex patterns of cause-and-effect that structure the specific dynamics of change. 

Truth is the most accurate understanding of reality. With accuracy, one projects their best possible power towards intended results. With realism, one maps abstract ideals to actual, granular possibilities.

Truth is learned as true information flows into correct interpretation. Truth is understood in pieces. Truths vary in value. The value of a truth based on how quickly it can be learned, how it changes the future, and how it changes the experience between the present and that future.

Filter truth from information.

## Preparation

Truth prepares action. Truth prepares the mind to perform the best available action.

The preparation of truth takes time. Time is limited. Therefore one should pursue and prepare only the most useful truths.

Preparation can be useful once, multiple times, or continuously. Useful now, soon, or later. 

* Learning a language to interpret useful information across a lifetime (continuous, long-term value)
* Reading a verification number to authorize a password reset (single-use, immediate value)
* Referencing a math formula sheet to complete a calculation (reusable, immediate value)
* Planning a shopping list before going to the grocery store (reusable, short-term value)

Preparation involves knowledge and logic. Preparation is best done in logical sequence (learning curve). Preparation requires truthful internal processing (critical thinking). Preparation is accelerated by truthful external resources (educational observations). 

## Using This Resource

We expend great effort to create resilient designs, procure quality tools, establish sensible standards, and find dependable suppliers. That said, we are always in the process of testing new technologies and using barely sufficient technologies based on new recent products and limited immediate options. Therefore we explicitly label our confident suggestions as "recommended" and "strongly recommended", for what meets and exceeds our standard of resilient value after thorough evaluation.
