## This

This is the Guidebolt Public Knowledge Base.

It is a free information resource for your benefit.

It contains a small fraction of our private records based on our experience as a company.

It purposes to teach the efficient truth for engineers, entrepreneurs, researchers, and similar decision-makers.

## Truth

Information drives every thought, decision, and action. In our increasingly complex world where logic and trust are hard to weave confidently, it is easy to be misled by noise, incur unknown risks, and waste valuable resources. Truth is the fundamental solution.

Truth is reality in its past, present, and future. What has been, what is, what could be, and what will be. Truth is the immediate state of the world and the complex patterns of cause-and-effect that structure the specific dynamics of change. 

Truth is the most accurate understanding of reality. With accuracy, one projects their best possible power towards intended results. With realism, one maps abstract ideals to actual possibilities.

## Preparation

Truth prepares the best possible action as relevant questions meet actionable answers. The truth of everything always points to the best answer, yet an incomplete truth can point to the worst answer. Every situation creates context for some truths to become good (improves the answer), neutral (no effect), or bad (worsens the answer). Some good truths are the sum of smaller truths that individually are bad or do not change the answer. For a given situation, all its good truths point to the best answer. Preparation is the completion of good truths.




 
## Using This Resource

We expend great effort to create resilient designs, procure quality tools, establish sensible standards, and find dependable suppliers. That said, we are always testing new technologies and using sufficient technologies based on new recent products and limited immediate options. Therefore we explicitly label our confident suggestions as "recommended" and "strongly recommended", for what meets and exceeds our standard of resilient value after thorough evaluation. That said, remember that your needs may overlap with ours in different ways, so we still advise careful consideration.
