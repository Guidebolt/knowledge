**Information drives every thought, decision, and action.** In our increasingly complex world where logic and trust are hard to weave confidently, it is easy to be misled by noise, incur unknown risks, and waste valuable resources. **Truth is the fundamental solution.**	

Truths cost **time** (read/watch/listen/think). Some truths are **useful** (some more than others); some truths are **joyful**; some truths **mislead**; some truths make **no difference**. Different truths serve different **goals** and **situations**.  

This resource uses a  **high-efficiency content style** that is mainly intended for rigorous technical learners/professionals/users.
