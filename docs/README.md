## The Efficient Truth

Information drives every thought, decision, and action. In our increasingly complex world where logic and trust are hard to weave confidently, it is easy to be misled by noise, incur unknown risks, and waste valuable resources. Truth is the fundamental solution.

You live in a specific situation with limited abilities and possibilities. Ideally, you map your best intent to the best path, then you take the best action to align reality with your intended future. In practice, you are heavily constrained by imperfect knowledge and limited thinking skills (ex. reading speed) in a world full of wrong ideas and irrelevant truths that can derail your pursuit of better knowledge for a better solution. Therefore, you want truths that are **relevant**; personalized for your situation/intent/path. Truths that are delivered **concisely**; personalized to your learning-curve for best speed and depth. Truths that you receive at the **best timing**; personalized for your schedule of learn-to-prepare and learn-while-doing. This is the efficient truth and it is the guiding solution.

## Explicit Recommendations

Just because we use something does NOT mean that it is good!

Sometimes we try something basic to build intuition about what makes something good. Sometimes we do not have time to research towards something great, so we settle for something ok. Sometimes we get something that we think is good then.. we realize it is not good.

When we have truly found something good or great, we explicitly write "recommended" or "strongly recommended", for what meets and exceeds our standard of resilient value after basic and thorough evaluation. We know that the tool/part/material selection process can be extremely time-consuming and mistake-expensive. Rely on us to guide your procurement process through clear and confident suggestions for proven quality.
