# Knowledge Theory

## Truth

Information drives every thought, decision, and action. In our increasingly complex world where logic and trust are hard to weave confidently, it is easy to be misled by noise, incur unknown risks, and waste valuable resources. Truth is the fundamental solution.

Truth is reality in its past, present, and future. What has been, what is, what could be, and what will be. Truth is the immediate state of the world and the complex patterns of cause-and-effect that structure the specific dynamics of change.

Truth is the most accurate understanding of reality. With accuracy, one projects their best possible power towards intended results. With realism, one maps abstract ideals to actual possibilities.

## Preparation

### Completion

Truth prepares the best possible action as relevant questions meet actionable answers. The truth of everything always points to the best answer, yet an incomplete truth can point to the worst answer. Every situation creates context for some truths to become good (improves the answer), neutral (no effect), or bad (worsens the answer). Some good truths are the sum of smaller truths that individually are bad or do not change the answer. For a given situation, all or enough of its good truths always point to the best answer. Preparation is the completion of good truths.

**Example, Baited Traps**: You are driving on an isolated road. You see a person laying face-down on the road (truth1). You can help this person get off the road for safety then call for medical assistance if necessary (truth2). After you exit your car and approach the person, you will be ambushed by 20 cultists and killed (truth3). For this situation, truth1 and truth2 are bad and directly mislead you to your doom.

**Example, Product Requirements**: You are buying a new refrigerator. You find a good one that exceeds your expectations on power efficiency, durability, and ease of cleaning (truth1). After you buy it and receive the shipment, you will discover that the refrigerator is too big to fit through your non-standard doorway (truth2). For this situation, truth1 is bad even though the refrigerator itself is excellent.

### Efficiency

Preparation takes time. Ideally, full preparation of the next action takes less time than the current action.

### Mapping

Knowing the information you need. Mapping the unique situation to your versatile toolbox.

Do you want just the answer? Or also the reasoning?

Answer-focused preparation is fast but requires a strong truth source that considers your unique situation.

Reasoned preparation requires you to understand the key ideas but offers first-hand verification of the solution's logic.

## Idea

Ideas are fragments of information.

Ideas are wordless but ideas can be represented by symbols.

Keywords represent ideas yet

Meaning?

## Types

###

* Index
* Dictionary
* Encyclopedia
* Guide
* Tutorial

* Symbolic Representation
* Composition
* Association
* Answer, Logic

## Process

Fundamental thinking actions to understand and control your information flow.

### Observe

Observe to gather raw information.

**Example, Vision**: What you see with your eyes is fundamentally a canvas of colors combined with natural depth perception. Without supporting ideas, only a single colorful scene exists. No separation of objects, behind-view inferrence, cause-effect prediction, directional sense, or hand-eye coordination.

### Interpret

Transform raw information into clear ideas.

**Example, Natural**: The outline of a human figure in the forest.

**Example, Symbolic**: The word "hungry".

### Filter Unique

The repetition of existing knowledge does not expand your knowledge. Pursue unfamiliar ideas.

**Example, Trite**:

### Connect

When familiar or unfamiliar ideas fill your active memory, combine them to generate new ideas and clarify old ones.

**Example, Familiar Combination**: What is the sum of "event", "agreement", and "schedule"? Appointment.

### Filter Useful

### Remember

Store and recall ideas.

The mind is strong at conceptual thinking. Focus on storing and connecting fundamental ideas. Details can be referenced from external stores easily.

### Reduce Access Time

For the access of specific ideas from internal and external memory.

**Example, Internal Access**: List 10 significant ideas associated with your area of expertise. Note the marginal time spent from the first to the 10th.

**Example, External Access**: Go to Wikipedia and search for something. Note the time spent.

### Create Memory Index

### Map to Future

**Example, Timing**: In 60 seconds, a stray bullet will pass through door A. In 55 seconds, a civilian bystander will be walking towards door A.
