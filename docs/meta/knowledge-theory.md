# Knowledge Theory

## Truth

Information drives every thought, decision, and action. In our increasingly complex world where logic and trust are hard to weave confidently, it is easy to be misled by noise, incur unknown risks, and waste valuable resources. Truth is the fundamental solution.

Truth is reality in its past, present, and future. What has been, what is, what could be, and what will be. Truth is the immediate state of the world and the complex patterns of cause-and-effect that structure the specific dynamics of change.

Truth is the most accurate understanding of reality. With accuracy, one projects their best possible power towards intended results. With realism, one maps abstract ideals to actual possibilities.

## Preparation

Truth prepares the best possible action as relevant questions meet actionable answers. The truth of everything always points to the best answer, yet an incomplete truth can point to the worst answer. Every situation creates context for some truths to become good (improves the answer), neutral (no effect), or bad (worsens the answer). Some good truths are the sum of smaller truths that individually are bad or do not change the answer. For a given situation, all or enough of its good truths always point to the best answer. Preparation is the completion of good truths.

**Example, Baited Traps**: You are driving on an isolated road. You see a person laying face-down on the road (truth1). You can help this person get off the road for safety then call for medical assistance if necessary (truth2). After you exit your car and approach the person, you will be ambushed by 20 cultists and killed (truth3). For this situation, truth1 and truth2 are bad and directly mislead you to your doom.

**Example, Product Requirements**: You are buying a new refrigerator. You find a good one that exceeds your expectations on power efficiency, durability, and ease of cleaning (truth1). After you buy it and receive the shipment, you will discover that the refrigerator is too big to fit through your non-standard doorway (truth2). For this situation, truth1 is bad even though the refrigerator itself is excellent.

## Idea, Keyword

What is an idea? An idea is a mental representation of reality. It is a meaningful fragment of information. It is wordless yet symbolically expressible through a keyword.

What is a keyword? A keyword is a physical representation of an idea. A keyword is observed (physically) then interpreted (mentally) as an idea. A keyword is usually a compact pattern of distinct elements (letters) in some constrained pattern-space (language), but it can be any physical pattern. Keywords are usually standardized for repeated use with common understanding, but they can be defined for single-use purposes (ex. temporary codenames).

**Example, Gibberish**: What are ideas that can be interpreted from "LZQPM"? There exists some text that says "LZQPM" on this page (idea1). The text "LZQPM" is an unfamiliar keyword that means an important idea for other people (idea2). The text "LZQPM" starts with the familiar military keyword "LZ" which means landing zone (idea3).

## Efficiency

Consider the difference between knowing the answer and knowing the reasoning as well. The most simple preparation is to blindly trust and follow the instructions of a truth source. Raw answers are time-efficient but strongly depend on the reliability of the truth source, miss opportunities for critical thinking growth, perpetuates transparent dependence, and requires customization for unique situational factors. The most complex preparation is to independently consider every relevant factor and logical step to plan a course of action. Independent verification provides consistently-complete optimizations but is time-consuming, skill-testing, and sometimes requires information that is hard/slow to access.

The efficiency of preparation involves thinking-time and action-time. The ideal efficiency of preparation completes the good truths of the next-task (thinking time) during the current task before it is complete (action time). In other words, ideal preparation incurs no physical down-time and achieves the best solutions by planning the next task (complete, fast) during the current task.

The efficiency of thinking involves the speed and accuracy of idea-flows. Every situation requires a certain number of ideas in a certain sequence to plan the best solution (ideal idea sequence). Accuracy is a qualitative measure of how much the actual idea sequence (of the thinker) deviates from the ideal idea sequence (theoretical). Speed is a quantitative measure of how many ideas are processed (by the thinker) per second/minute/hour.

## Definition, Organization

What is a "definition"? A definition is a combination of known ideas used to describe the unknown idea of an unfamiliar keyword.

**Example, Tool**: Tools are physical things that broaden or deepen the interactive ability of a mind on reality. The human body is the fundamental tool of the human mind.

What is "organization"? Organization means connecting known ideas together to build a greater idea or a mental model with greater complexity and accuracy.

**Example, Mineral Map**: Combine the simple ideas "map", "mineral", "density", "elevation" to get the complex idea of "a topographic map of minerals in the area categorized by ore density and vein elevation".

## Consideration, Memory

What is consideration? Considering is the movement of an idea from subconscious storage to active memory. Because it is possible to know good ideas yet fail to consider them during a relevant task, organizing good ideas for fast-relevant consideration is important.

What is memory? Memory is a container of known information. Memory exists on a spectrum of ease-of-access, from internal (ex. human brain) to external (ex. USB drive). External electronic memory is an efficient way to improve thinking consistency (ex. checklist) and reliability (ex. greater retention rate compared to typical human forgetfulness), but bounded by access time and tool requirements. Memory also exists on a dynamic spectrum of logical activity, from active memory (conscious) to archived memory (subconscious). Memory is understood as blocks that can be evaluated at different levels of scope and quantity (ex. a book is a larger memory block than one of its paragraphs).

## Knowledge Types

What are knowledge types? Knowledge types are general categories of memory blocks based on what ideas are included and how the ideas are arranged for observation by the intended audience.

### Index

What is an index? It is a list of keywords related to a central idea. An index is usually organized alphabetically, but it can be arranged in any meaningful sequence.

When is an index useful? Good, it is the most efficient presentation of ideas for consideration when their definitions and interconnections are internally well-known.

### Dictionary

What is a dictionary? It is a list of keywords and their definitions.

### Encyclopedia

What is an encyclopedia? It is a list of keywords and their generic explanations.

### Tutorial

What is a tutorial? It is a chronological sequence of specific, actionable instructions for getting something done.

## Thinking Process

Fundamental thinking actions to understand and control your information flow.

### Observe

Observe to gather raw information.

**Example, Vision**: What you see with your eyes is fundamentally a canvas of colors combined with natural depth perception. Without supporting ideas, only a single colorful scene exists. No separation of objects, behind-view inferrence, cause-effect prediction, directional sense, or hand-eye coordination.

### Interpret

Transform raw information into clear ideas.

**Example, Natural**: The outline of a human figure in the forest.

**Example, Symbolic**: The word "hungry".

### Filter Unique

The repetition of existing knowledge does not expand your knowledge. Pursue unfamiliar ideas.

**Example, Trite**:

### Connect


**Example, Familiar Combination**: What is the sum of "event", "agreement", and "schedule"? Appointment.

### Filter Useful

### Remember

Store and recall ideas.

The mind is strong at conceptual thinking. Focus on storing and connecting fundamental ideas. Details can be referenced from external stores easily.

### Reduce Access Time

For the access of specific ideas from internal and external memory.

**Example, Internal Access**: List 10 significant ideas associated with your area of expertise. Note the marginal time spent from the first to the 10th.

**Example, External Access**: Go to Wikipedia and search for something. Note the time spent.

### Create Memory Index





### Map to Future

**Example, Timing**: In 60 seconds, a stray bullet will pass through door A. In 55 seconds, a civilian bystander will be walking towards door A.

### Map to Action
