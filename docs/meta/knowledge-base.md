# Knowledge Base

## Using This Resource

We expend great effort to create resilient designs, procure quality tools, establish sensible standards, and find dependable suppliers. That said, we are always testing new technologies and using sufficient technologies based on new recent products and limited immediate options. Therefore we explicitly label our confident suggestions as "recommended" and "strongly recommended", for what meets and exceeds our standard of resilient value after thorough evaluation. That said, remember that your needs may overlap with ours in different ways, so we still advise careful consideration.
