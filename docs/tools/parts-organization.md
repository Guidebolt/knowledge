## Label Printer

## Hard Organizer

MILWAUKEE, Packout Series - [Product Info](https://www.milwaukeetool.com/Products/Storage-Solutions/PACKOUT)

Hard frame organizers are faster to see and access than individual bags. Prefer organizers with removable subcontainers for ease of parts transfer. We recommend the packout series for its sturdy single-frame construction, convenient latching stackability, and ergonomic primary latches.
