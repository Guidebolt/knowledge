Recommendation, install operating-systems on a per-drive basis (instead of multiple OS partitions on the same drive). 

## Hardware

SSD: SAMSUNG, Pro Series (strongly recommended)

We've used consumer-grade SAMSUNG SSDs for over 8 years with success. Our mature recommendation is the SAMSUNG 970 PRO 1TB (PCIE Gen3 x4 NVMe, M.2-2280-KeyM). Note that its successor, the SAMSUNG PRO 980, is just about released in 2020.

## Password Manager

[Keepass](https://keepass.info) - Free, open-source, good long-term track record. But out-dated, clunky GUI. Recommended.

[KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) - Free, open-source, cross-platform, modern GUI with v2.6+. A fork of Keepass with more active development that we are testing.

Regularly save a copy of your password-database to a backup-system.

## Basic Programs

[Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)- Office Suite - Free, open-source, high-quality, cross-platform alternative to Microsoft Word for producing text documents, spreadsheets, slideshows, and basic drawings. Great import/export compatibility for various file formats.

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) - Vector graphics editor. Create or edit logos, line art, infographics, and other line-based images.

[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - Raster Graphics Editor - Produce, resize, crop, rotate, and retouch your photos and other dot-style image files.

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) - Audio Editor - Record your voice or music, manipulate audio clips for your media library, and import-export different filetypes. Great for handling standard audio tasks like other digital audio workstations (DAWs).

## MCAD

[Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview)

Based on valid concerns expressed in [this forum thread](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/moving-to-subscription/buh-bye-permanent-license/td-p/6916387), we are considering alternatives such as Solid Edge (SIEMENS) or BricsCAD (Hexagon).

[FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) is accessible and basically functional, but we consider the featureset and UI/UX too limited for professional workflows for now.

## ECAD

We use [Kicad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org/) for most of our schematic-to-PCB ECAD work. This is a good free, open-source, cross-platform EDA suite sponsored by CERN and increasingly supported by the industry such as with the [Digikey Kicad Library](https://www.digikey.ca/en/resources/design-tools/kicad).

Industry-standard suites include:

* Altium
* Cadence (Allegro/Orcad)
* SIEMENS Mentor (PADS/Xpedition)
