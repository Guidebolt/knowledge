## MCAD

[Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview)

Based on valid concerns expressed in [this forum thread](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/moving-to-subscription/buh-bye-permanent-license/td-p/6916387), we are considering alternatives such as Solid Edge (SIEMENS) or BricsCAD (Hexagon).

[FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) is accessible and basically functional, but we consider the featureset and UI/UX too limited for professional workflows for now.

## ECAD

We use [Kicad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org/) for most of our schematic-to-PCB ECAD work. This is a good free, open-source, cross-platform EDA suite sponsored by CERN and increasingly supported by the industry such as with the [Digikey Kicad Library](https://www.digikey.ca/en/resources/design-tools/kicad).

Industry-standard suites include:

* Altium
* Cadence (Allegro/Orcad)
* SIEMENS Mentor (PADS/Xpedition)
