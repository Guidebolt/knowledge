# Computer Workstation

REV: 2020-09-04

## Operating System

PRIMARY: [DEBIAN](https://www.debian.org/)

SECONDARY: [WINDOWS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows)

* [Windows 10, ISO Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10ISO)

We like to install operating-systems on a per-drive basis (instead of multiple OS partitions on the same drive).

## SSD

We've used consumer-grade SAMSUNG drives for over 8 years with success.

Recommendation: SAMSUNG, 970 PRO, 1TB (PCIE Gen3 x4 NVMe, M.2-2280-KeyM)

Interested: SAMSUNG, 980 PRO, 1TB (PCIE Gen4 x4 NVMe)

We use M.2 enclosures to assemble external data drives with greater capacity, reliability, speed, and modularity than normal USB drives.

Testing: STARTECH, M2E1BRU31C

## Power Supply

We prefer high-reliability and fanless designs. SEASONIC is a proven source with 12-year warranties.

Testing: SEASONIC, Prime Series

## CPU

Interested: AMD, Ryzen 4000 Series

## Case

We like durable, easy-to-assemble, light-weight, compact-volume, compatible. We like passive-cooling but accept current limits for high-power designs.

Testing: FRACTAL DESIGN, Define 7 Compact, All Solid Panels

## USB Drive

USB drives are versatile.

* Device-to-Device File Transfer
* Live OS Installation
* Full Small-Disk Backup

Recommendation: SAMSUNG, Bar Plus

We use a dedicated case for storing USB drives.

Recommendation: NANUK, 903

## Mouse Pad

Testing: RAZER, Gigantus V2, XXL (410mm x 910mm x 4mm)

## Password Manager

We strongly recommend that you use a password-manager that works offline (without internet).

We strongly recommend that you regularly save a copy of your password-database to a back-up system.

[Keepass](https://keepass.info) - Free, open-source, good long-term track record. But out-dated, clunky GUI. Recommended.

[KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) - Free, open-source, cross-platform, modern GUI with v2.6+. A fork of Keepass with more active development that we are testing.

## Document Suite

[Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Free, open-source, high-quality, cross-platform alternative to Microsoft Word for producing text documents, spreadsheets, slideshows, and basic drawings. Great import/export compatibility for various file formats.

## Text Editor

[Atom](https://atom.io/) - Free, simple, customizable integrated development environment (IDE). Developed by Github.

[RETEXT](https://pypi.org/project/ReText/) - Markdown editor with live preview.

## Team Chat

## Audio Editor

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) - Audio Editor - Record your voice or music, manipulate audio clips for your media library, and import-export different filetypes. Great for handling standard audio tasks like other digital audio workstations (DAWs).

## Video Editor

## MCAD

[Autodesk Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview)

Based on valid concerns expressed in [this forum thread](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/moving-to-subscription/buh-bye-permanent-license/td-p/6916387), we are considering alternatives such as Solid Edge (SIEMENS) or BricsCAD (Hexagon).

[FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) is accessible and basically functional, but we consider the featureset and UI/UX limiting for professional workflows.

## ECAD

[Kicad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org/) for most of our schematic-to-PCB ECAD work. This is a good free, open-source, cross-platform EDA suite sponsored by CERN and increasingly supported by the industry such as with the [Digikey Kicad Library](https://www.digikey.ca/en/resources/design-tools/kicad).

Industry-standard alternatives include:

* Altium
* Cadence (Allegro/Orcad)
* SIEMENS Mentor (PADS/Xpedition)
