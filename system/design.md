# SYSTEM - DESIGN

## Idealism

Idea: The best design of a system or technology when certain constraints are removed.

Example: A waterbottle that contains 10X its volume as water.

Example: A waterbottle that teleports water into the mouth automatically within 100m.

Example: A waterbottle that satisfies the human body's need for water without consuming water.

## Possibility

Idea: A state of the real world, now or later, preceded by a specific course of action. 

Example: A person pursues the possibility of driving to the grocery store and back within 30 minutes as usual. The car struggles to crank, requiring help from a friendly neighbor. The driver is stopped by police who noticed their expired license plate. The grocery store is closed for holidays this weekend.

## Requirement

Idea: A description of the desired parts of a system, such as form, function, and cost, with varying priorities.

Example: The refrigerator must stabilize the temperature of a sealed, accessible, internal volume at a configurable value between -5 and 10 degrees Celsius, at a minimum of 100W heat transfer rate, with total volume under 2 cubic meters, operating at 90% or better efficiency, costed under $1000 for 10K unit production.

Notes: Requirements challenge possibilities and invite specifications. Requirements must be compatible with each other. Conflicting requirements should be further specified to explore parallel solutions that can address both intentions. 

## Specification 

Idea: A well-defined part of the design. 

Example: This refrigerator has a total volume of 1.4 cubic meters.

## Completeness

Idea: The degree to which a design's information maps (accurately and deeply) to all definable elements of the intended real world outcome.

Example: The complete design of a metal cube defines not only the material and length but also the edge radius, surface finish, production tolerances, and any special traits from procedures such as annealing, tempering, anodizing, magnetizing, coloring, cleaning.

## Scope

Idea: The degree to which a design is considered (across time, use categories, value factors) to affect the total system in which the design is applied.

Example: The scope of good car design covers safety edge cases involving roll-over conditions, crumple zones, airbag performance, fire/explosion prevention measures, and special driver/passenger escape workflows.

## Optimization

Idea: The improvement of a design at specific metrics under a certain scope.

Example: This processor has 2X faster single-threaded performance but with 10W additional thermal power.
